# LAB3-biostatisticsReport
Biostatistic report 

Brief Description
         The third lab consists of an awk program that reads input from a csv file and calculates the total sum and averages for 
         specific columns. It calculates the sum of the third, fourth  and fifth column. After summation, the average was calculated 
         by dividing each column sum with the number of records. The csv file was downloaded from the free source website. The data of
         the csv file was not modified and it was used to demonstrate how the interpreter programming language can be utilized. A makefile 
         was included in the github repository.
